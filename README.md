# Lab3D-PostCovid
 Continuation/adaptation of the work made and stored at github.com/pusacaspica/lab3d-precovid
 
 This repository contains most of the works concerning the scientific initiation project at the Laborat√≥rio de Realidade Virtual da COPPE in between January 2020 and March 2020.

The files inside this repository run on Unity 2019.3. Differently from the other Unity Project, this one was made so it'll work fine without a camera.

This repository contains a rework of the molecule builder in which molecules can be built by joining atoms together with validation of said molecule happening on the fly by the valence of each atom involved. The different kinds of atomic bonding are also represented by the behavior of the eletrons of the atoms that compound the molecule.

To-do:
 - Add the augmented reality (AR) component;
 - Set the AR to work with what's ready;
 - Consider unstable molecules as valid (although temporary);
 - Proof-test the application so it won't show any invalid molecules
 
 It has been said that the initial approach of using prefabs for the molecules is viable once the application was originally intended for a specific environment, so the cost of looking for files doesn't represent a real problem.
